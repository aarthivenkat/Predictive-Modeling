# Recommender Systems and Web Mining
### Taught by Julian McAuley  
This machine learning class designed to teach and test Python implementation of recommender systems, data mining, and predictive analytics. For my final project, I was required to identify and write a predictive task with a large dataset (>50,000 datapoints). While most students used pre-curated and cleaned datasets from Facebook, Amazon, Yelp, etc., I chose to utilize my interest and impact in bioinformatics to perform multi-class text classification of PubMed abstracts by GO term.
