# Recommender Systems and Web Mining
### Taught by Julian McAuley  
This machine learning class designed to teach and test Python implementation of recommender systems, data mining, and predictive analytics. For my final project, I was required to identify and write a predictive task with a large dataset (>50,000 datapoints). As such, I wrote a multi-class text classification script to classify PubMed abstracts by GO term. [See more description and expectation here(http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa18/cse158-a/).
